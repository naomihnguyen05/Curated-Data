## âœ¨Artist Statementâœ¨
I take joy in anything beautiful and aesthetically pleasing. As a creative student, all art forms to me is an expression and a reason to enjoy life. Growing up, I wanted to be a fashion designer and would spend my days sketching clothes or crafting them into a booklet. To me, this randomizer is a meaningful "grown up" version of a dream that I couldn't achieve. While, I may not be studying fashion design, it's amazing how I can combine a passion from 13 years ago to one that uses my actual creative skill sets!
